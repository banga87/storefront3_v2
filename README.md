# Ecommerce Backend with Django
<a href=https://mosh-django-ecommerce.herokuapp.com/store>Live API Interface</a>
<br>
I've left the Products and Collections end points open.
<br>
This project was completed via a comprehensive 3 part series learning Django. My objective was to complete the course and feel confident to begin working on a self driven project of my choosing.
<br>
The project was truly a standout compare to some of the other courses I've completed. It exposed me to as much of a lifecycle of development as I could have asked for. From building the models, to creating views, to user authentication to deploying live on Heroku! That last step was super exciting.

<h2>Lessons Learnt</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Keep a record of your lessons learnt!</li>
  <li>Version control. Major issue overcome trying to run an incompatible version of Python with Celery on a Windows machine. This was a nightmare error for a newbie!</li>
  <li>I wasn't confident with the concept of client/server relationship. This course has absolutely smashed that out of the park. If I had a dollar every time I had to work through a serialization to either pull data via a response or send a request..I'd have a bit of cash.</li>
  <li>Good sleep, good food, well timed coffee. Working through this project opened my eyes to how important it is for developers to be clear headed and full of energy in order to get the best out. I can confidently say I have never had such good sleep and eaten so well simply because I enjoyed working at my peak and HATED not working at my peak.</li>
  <li>Plenty more stuffed away in extremely detailed notes. I would be able to create a YouTube series with the detail in my notes.</li>
